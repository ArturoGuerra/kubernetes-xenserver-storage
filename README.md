# Kubernetes XenServer Storage

***NOT PRODUCTION READY!!!*** *... yet*

**WARNING:**
XenServer credentials will be passed on every node and persisted to disk for every volume.
At the moment this is the only way to provide XenServer storage support to Kubernetes.
The next release which will be build against 1.10 should however address this.

## Getting Started

Install the *provisioner* and *driver*.
Detailed informations can be found in their respecive directories.
